# Code of Conduct Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and leaders, commit to ensuring that our community provides a harassment-free experience for all, irrespective of age, physical appearance, visible or invisible disabilities, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of expertise, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We promise to engage in ways that foster an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy environment.

## Conduct Standards
Positive conduct within our community includes:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others.
Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
Giving and receiving constructive feedback graciously.
Acknowledging and apologizing for our mistakes, and learning from them.
Prioritizing what's best for the community as a whole, not just individual interests.
Unacceptable behavior includes:

Usage of sexualized language or imagery, or any form of sexual attention or advances.
Trolling, making derogatory comments, or engaging in personal or political attacks.
Harassment, either publicly or privately.
Revealing others' private information without explicit consent.
Any behavior considered inappropriate in a professional context.
Enforcement Responsibilities
Our community leaders are tasked with defining and upholding acceptable behavior. They will respond promptly and fairly to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

They hold the authority to remove, modify, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate the rationale behind their decisions when necessary.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies across all community spaces, whether online or offline. It also applies when an individual officially represents the community in public forums, such as using an official email address or posting via an official social media account.

##Reporting and Review
Instances of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior can be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [contact email].

All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated.

The privacy and security of the reporter of any incident will be respected by all community leaders.
